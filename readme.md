## Installation

### Theme
  The theme is based on the wonderfully made [ys](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/blob/master/themes/ys.zsh-theme) theme from the official [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh).

  1. Drop `z.zsh-theme` into the `~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/` directory.

  2. Change the theme variable name to `ZSH_THEME="z"` in `~/.zshrc`.

  3. Reload ZSH with command `source ~/.zshrc.
